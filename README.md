# Next *μ*

**Next *μ*** or **Next Micro** is a Pro Micro/[Elite-C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Elite-C) compatible ATmega32U4 board, specialized design for keyboards.

It has mid-mount USB Type-C and more available pins (25 pins, all pins of ATmega32U4 except `PE2/HWB`) than both Pro Micro (18 pins) and Elite-C (24 pins).  
The on-board RESET button makes development easier.
